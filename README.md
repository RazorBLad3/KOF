## About

KOF is a cheat program for the Knight Online. aka Koxp

The reason I created this project was to understand how to cheat in online games.

I previously developed this project in Visual Basic .NET, but due to some technical limitations I modernized it with C#

If you want to look at the old project [trkyshorty/KOF-VB.Net](https://github.com/trkyshorty/KOF-VB.Net)
